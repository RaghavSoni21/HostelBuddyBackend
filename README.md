Project Title: **Hostel Buddy - Simplifying Room Exchange for Students**

Project Description:
Hostel Buddy is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the process of room exchange and direct room type change for students residing in hostels. 
The platform offers a user-friendly interface where students can easily apply for mutual exchange of rooms or request a direct room type change, all facilitated through a robust backend built using the MERN stack.

Key Features:

1. **User Authentication and Profiles**: Users can create accounts or log in using their existing credentials. Upon logging in, students can view their profiles, including their current room details and any pending room exchange requests.

2. **Room Exchange Requests**: Hostel Buddy enables students to submit requests for mutual exchange of rooms. They can browse through available rooms based on preferences such as room type, floor, or amenities. The application allows students to send and receive exchange requests from other users. Additionally, students can communicate with potential roommates through an integrated messaging system.

3. **Direct Room Type Change**: In addition to mutual exchange requests, students can also request a direct room type change. This feature allows students to submit a request to the hostel administration for a change in their room type based on availability and eligibility criteria.

4. **Real-time Notifications**: Hostel Buddy keeps users informed about the status of their requests through real-time notifications. Users receive alerts when there are updates to their exchange requests or when new room options become available.

5. **Admin Dashboard**: The application includes an admin dashboard that allows hostel administrators to manage user accounts, review and approve room exchange requests, allocate rooms based on availability, and monitor overall system activity.

6. **Search and Filtering Options**: To enhance user experience, Hostel Buddy provides advanced search and filtering options. Students can search for specific room types, amenities, or available rooms on particular floors, making it easier to find suitable accommodation options.

7. **Feedback and Rating System**: After completing a room exchange or direct room type change, students can provide feedback and ratings to their former roommates or hostel administration. This helps maintain transparency and accountability within the system.

8. **Data Security and Privacy**: Hostel Buddy prioritizes the security and privacy of user data. All sensitive information is encrypted, and access controls are implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify user data.

By leveraging the power of the MERN stack, Hostel Buddy offers a reliable and scalable solution for students to manage their accommodation preferences effectively. Whether it's swapping rooms with peers or requesting a change in room type, Hostel Buddy simplifies the process, fostering a seamless living experience in hostels.
